## Description: 📝
This dataset comprises detailed records of carbonation-induced damage in various concrete elements. It includes 2,500 observations, covering aspects such as carbonation depth, pH changes, reinforcement corrosion rates, and visual damage indicators. The data spans over a wide range of concrete types, environmental conditions, and exposure durations.

## Project summary, description, or abstract: 📚

The dataset aims to serve as a foundational resource for research on carbonation-induced damage in concrete structures. It provides a diverse set of data points for analyzing the impact of environmental conditions, concrete compositions, and protective measures on the rate and extent of carbonation damage. This dataset can be utilized for both empirical research and for training predictive models to estimate carbonation depth and corrosion initiation times.

# The dataset includes the following columns: 🔬

- Carbonation depth (mm)
- pH level
- Reinforcement corrosion rate (µm/year)
- Environmental exposure condition
- Concrete type
- Age of concrete (years)
- Visual damage rating
Each row represents a distinct sample, with data collected from both laboratory experiments and field surveys.

# This dataset can advance research and practical applications in several areas: ✨

- **Damage prediction**: Empowering the development of models to predict carbonation depth and corrosion initiation.

- **Material science**: Facilitating the study of concrete formulations and their resistances to carbonation.

## Description of files: ✍️
The repository contains a primary data file named `CarbonConcreteData.csv`, which contains the raw data. Additionally, a Jupyter notebook `DataAnalysis.ipynb` is provided for a basic analysis of the dataset.
