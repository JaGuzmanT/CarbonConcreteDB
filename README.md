## Description: üìù
This dataset comprises detailed photographs of carbonation-induced damage in various concrete elements. It includes 1,200 images, divided into two groups: carbonated samples and Uncarbonated samples. The images directly relate to prismatic elements  (5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm) obtained from various concrete elements under laboratory conditions.

## Project summary, description, or abstract: üìö

The dataset aims to serve as a foundational resource for research on carbonation-induced damage in concrete structures. It provides a diverse set of image data points for analyzing the impact of environmental conditions, concrete compositions, and protective measures on the rate and extent of carbonation damage. This dataset can be utilized for classification, detection, and segmentation problems. With this valuable information, Computer vision approaches might be applied to enhance the efficiency of damage evaluations and deprecate the subjectivity of visual assessments.

# The image dataset includes two categories: üî¨

- Carbonated Samples
- Uncarbonated samples

# This dataset can advance research and practical applications in several areas: ‚ú®

- **Damage analysis**: Empowering the development of models to detect and localize damaged zones caused by the carbonation process might reduce the time-consuming tasks of visual inspection, avoid subjectivity, quantify the injured area over the concrete structures, and prevent corrosion initiation.

- **Material science**: Facilitating the study of concrete damage and the facts that might produce the carbonation phenomena.

## Description of files: ‚úçÔ∏è
The repository contains two main folders: `__Carbonated_samples__` and `__Uncarbonated_samples__.`
Each folder comprises JPG format images with various scales and pixel ranges.
